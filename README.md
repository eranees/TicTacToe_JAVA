Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a Java program for a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played by two players. The program uses Java Swing for the GUI and implements the ActionListener interface to handle the button clicks.

The game board is a 3x3 grid, and each player takes turns placing their symbol (X or O) on the board until one of the players wins or the game ends in a draw. The program checks for a win by checking the rows, columns, and diagonals of the board for three matching symbols.

The program uses an array of JButtons to represent the game board, and a JLabel to display the current player's turn and the game result. The program also uses colors to differentiate between the players and the winner.

To play the game, simply run the main method of the TicTacToe class.
